# claude-code project summary

## Scope

Manage Claude Code configuration: MCP servers, plugins, hooks, keybindings, memory, and CLAUDE.md structure.

## Current State

- Installed at `~/.local/bin`
- MCP servers injected from claude.ai account (audit pending — most are noise for this system)
- Persistent memory directory at `~/.claude/projects/-home-skogix/memory/`

## Open Concerns

- Which MCP servers to keep vs disable
- Vim-style keybindings
- Plugin and hook setup
- Memory system usage

See @TODO.md for full task breakdown.
