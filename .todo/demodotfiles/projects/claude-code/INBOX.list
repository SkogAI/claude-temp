- [x] audit and document mcp servers injected via claude.ai — solved: --strict-mcp-config + manual mcp.json
- [ ] audit plugins marketplace and decide what to enable — user will walk through later
- [x] set up settings, keybindings (vim-style), hooks — settings: --setting-sources "" + single file in skogai-core. hooks: debug hooks on all 9 events, confirmed working. keybindings: deferred
- [ ] document memory system and claude.md hierarchy — after config
- [x] The exact permission model — see docs/claude-code-at-linking.md
- [x] How Skill/slash commands work — commands → skills transition, context: fork, agent types, skills field on subagents, !`command` preprocessing, @path inclusion. see skogai-core/docs/plugin-anatomy.md
- [x] How hooks tie into tool execution — all 9 events documented and tested via debug hooks. PreToolUse/PostToolUse wrap tool calls, Stop/SubagentStop on completion, SessionStart/End lifecycle, UserPromptSubmit on input, PreCompact before compression, Notification on alerts
- [/] What settings.json and settings.local.json actually control — have single file now, need to learn what goes in it
- [x] The difference between what's in ~/.claude/ vs what Claude Code ships with — solved: wrapper controls everything. mcp.json for servers, skogai-core for plugin+settings, --strict and --setting-sources "" strip defaults
- [ ] Your specific settings — empty settings.json, fill as we hit needs
- [x] What slash commands are available — skills with SKILL.md, commands with .md in commands/, invoked via /plugin:name or Skill tool
- [ ] How the context compression works internally — single text prompt returning summary, good skills do this well
