# Claude Code Project

Manage Claude Code so sessions start clean with only the tools and config we actually want.

## Scope

- MCP server management (audit, disable unwanted)
- Settings and keybindings (vim-style)
- Plugins and hooks
- Memory system
- CLAUDE.md structure across all projects

## Workflow

Check @INBOX.list at the start of each session. Pick up items, execute or discuss, then remove processed lines.

## Files to read

- @SKOGAI.md - project summary and current state
- @TODO.md - task breakdown by area
- @INBOX.list - incoming items
