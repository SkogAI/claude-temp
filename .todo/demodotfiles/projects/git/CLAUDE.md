# projects/git

This project manages all git-related configuration and infrastructure: global gitconfig, SSH keys, GitHub CLI setup, and repo management conventions.

See [README.md](README.md) for the current git state and preferences — it serves as the canonical reference included by all projects.

## Workflow

Check @INBOX.list at the start of each session. It contains pending items — one per line, append-only. Pick up items, execute or discuss with the user, then remove processed lines.

## Files to read

- @SKOGAI.md - identity, auth, and conventions
- @README.md - canonical git reference
- @INBOX.list - incoming items
