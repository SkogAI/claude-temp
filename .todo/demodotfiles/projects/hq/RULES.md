- `@` is not part of the filesystem path — resolve `@README.md` as `./README.md`, `@~/file` as `/home/skogix/file`
- `@/path/to/file` means "this file is important, read it" always, everywhere
- `@/path/to/directory/` means "this folder and the files inside is important, please look at the file tree" always, everywhere
- Never create files or directories with a literal `@` in the name
- To communicate with other projects, use the `append <message>` tool on their INBOX.list to send them a message.
- `.list` is files which are write-only via the `append` tool
