# Remaining Setup Tasks

## High Priority

- [ ] AUR helper — install `paru` or `yay` for AUR packages
- [ ] Keyboard layout — `setxkbmap se` was run mid-session, make persistent
- [ ] Verify zsh config — oh-my-zsh / starship / whatever came from dotfiles
- [ ] Verify i3 config — was checked during bash session (`~/.config/i3/`)
- [ ] Ansible — `SkogAI/skogansible` was cloned to `~/.ansible`, not yet run

## Dev Tools (to investigate/install)

- [ ] Editor (neovim?)
- [ ] Programming languages (python, node, rust, go?)
- [ ] Container tools (docker/podman?)
- [ ] Terminal multiplexer (tmux/zellij?)
- [ ] Fonts (nerd fonts for terminal/i3bar?)

## System Polish

- [ ] Display/HiDPI settings (Dell Latitude 5520)
- [ ] Power management / TLP
- [ ] Audio (pipewire/pulseaudio)
- [ ] Bluetooth
- [ ] Network manager applet for i3
- [ ] Screen lock (i3lock?)
- [ ] File manager
- [ ] Screenshot tool
- [ ] Notification daemon

## Captured from History (not yet categorized)

- `SkogAI/skogansible` cloned to `~/.ansible` — likely automates much of the above
