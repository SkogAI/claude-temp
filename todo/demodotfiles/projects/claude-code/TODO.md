# Claude Code — TODO

## MCP Servers

- [x] MCP servers managed via `~/.claude/mcp.json` + `--mcp-config` flag
- [x] `--strict-mcp-config` in wrapper strips cloud-injected servers
- [x] arch-ops (`uvx arch-ops-server`) — keeping; wiki search, AUR security, news checking
- [ ] Evaluate adding more servers as needed

## Settings & Config

- [ ] Learn defaults before customizing — only change when hitting a real pain point
- [ ] Keybindings (vim-style) — defer until default bindings feel limiting

## Plugins

- [ ] Defer — learn what's built-in first

## Hooks

- [ ] Defer — learn what's built-in first

## Memory

- [x] MEMORY.md in project memory dir is auto-loaded into system prompt
- [ ] Continue learning how it works through use
