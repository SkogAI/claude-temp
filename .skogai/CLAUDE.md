<what_is_this>

the projects knowledge base, memory system, project tracking, and quick capture.
one place to see everything, remember everything, plan everything.

<architecture>

**Script Framework:** Uses argc for declarative CLI definition:

```bash
# @describe script description
# @arg name![`_choice_validator`] Argument description
main() { ... }
eval "$(argc --argc-eval "$0" "$@")"
```

</architecture>

<always_load>

- @memory/context/current.md - what we are currently working on

</always_load>

<important>

**@ is source of truth.** The `@/path` syntax expands real files at prompt-time.
Read tool often returns cached content. Always use `@` for files that must be current.

See @knowledge/learnings/2026-01-20-at-file-reference.md for details.
